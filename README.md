# Surfs Up Analysis

### Overview
In order to see my dream of a surf and shake shop come to fruition, I need to get my investor W. Avy on board (pun intended!) and to do that I need to provide him with weather data for the island in question for the months of June and December for the last few years so he can review and decide if this is worth his investment!


# Results?
- I'm delighted to report to W. Avy that whether it's summer or winter on the island, the max temperature is in the balmy 80 degree range! Perfect for surfing and ice cream.  
- And when we look at the minimum temperature comparison, it is quite cold in December- but I think with every seasonal business that's to be expected and accounted for.
- Lastly, the count of data captures for June was larger than December but not so markedly that it affects the data analysis for the temperature review. 

## Summary of Surfs Up Analysis:  
This temperature data was a good start, but there was so much more we could do.  I could run a query and track precipitation data to show W. Avy or review which stations are most active in recording weather data.  As this relationship, built on surf and sugar continues the data points to a bright future together.
